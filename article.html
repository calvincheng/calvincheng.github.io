          "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
          pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
          of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
          the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
          dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because
          those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
          consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
          loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
          but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
          procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
          ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
          advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
          chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
          avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
